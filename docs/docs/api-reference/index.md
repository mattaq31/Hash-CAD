# API Reference

This section provides the complete API documentation for both the Python (`crisscross-kit`) and Dart (#-CAD Flutter) components of this repository.

## Python API

The full python API is available [here](python-complete.md) and features all functions/classes from `crisscross`, `orthoseq_generator` and `eqcorr2d`.

## Dart API

The Dart API documentation is generated separately using **dartdoc** and hosted as static HTML within this documentation site, available [here](../flutter-api/index.html).

Developers can view the Dart API documentation locally through the following commands:

```bash
cd flutter_app

dart doc --output=../docs/docs/flutter-api
```
