# Vertex Cover Algorithms

The vertex cover algorithms module implements advanced optimization algorithms for selecting optimal subsets of DNA sequences from large libraries, ensuring maximum orthogonality and minimal cross-reactivity.

## Overview

Selecting the optimal subset of sequences from a large library is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. This module provides:

- **Graph-Based Optimization**: Model sequence interactions as graphs
- **Vertex Cover Algorithms**: Find optimal sequence subsets
- **Heuristic Methods**: Efficient approximation algorithms
- **Exact Solutions**: Optimal solutions for smaller problems
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate solution quality

## Core Algorithms

::: orthoseq_generator.vertex_cover_algorithms

## Algorithm Types

### Exact Algorithms

For smaller problems where optimal solutions are required:

- **Branch and Bound**: Systematic exploration with pruning
- **Integer Programming**: Mathematical optimization formulation
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimal substructure exploitation

### Approximation Algorithms

For larger problems where good solutions are needed quickly:

- **Greedy Algorithms**: Fast, reasonable quality solutions
- **Local Search**: Iterative improvement methods
- **Metaheuristics**: Advanced search strategies

### Hybrid Approaches

Combine multiple techniques for best performance:

- **Multi-stage Optimization**: Coarse-to-fine refinement
- **Algorithm Portfolios**: Run multiple algorithms in parallel
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Learn from previous solutions

## Usage Examples

!!! example "Basic Vertex Cover"
    ```python
    from orthoseq_generator import vertex_cover_algorithms
    from orthoseq_generator import sequence_computations
    
    # Create interaction graph from sequences
    sequences = load_sequence_library("large_library.fasta")
    interaction_graph = sequence_computations.build_interaction_graph(
        sequences, threshold=0.5
    )
    
    # Find optimal subset
    optimal_subset = vertex_cover_algorithms.min_vertex_cover(
        interaction_graph, method="greedy"
    )
    
    print(f"Selected {len(optimal_subset)} sequences from {len(sequences)}")
    ```

!!! example "Advanced Optimization"
    ```python
    # Use multiple algorithms and compare results
    algorithms = ["greedy", "local_search", "branch_bound"]
    results = {}
    
    for alg in algorithms:
        subset = vertex_cover_algorithms.min_vertex_cover(
            interaction_graph, method=alg
        )
        quality = vertex_cover_algorithms.evaluate_solution(
            subset, interaction_graph
        )
        results[alg] = {"subset": subset, "quality": quality}
    
    # Select best result
    best_algorithm = max(results.keys(), key=lambda x: results[x]["quality"])
    best_subset = results[best_algorithm]["subset"]
    ```

!!! example "Custom Optimization"
    ```python
    # Define custom optimization parameters
    params = {
        "max_iterations": 1000,
        "temperature_schedule": "exponential",
        "neighborhood_size": 50,
        "convergence_threshold": 1e-6
    }
    
    # Run customized optimization
    optimized_subset = vertex_cover_algorithms.optimize_subset(
        sequences, 
        objective_function="max_orthogonality",
        **params
    )
    ```

## Performance Considerations

### Algorithm Selection

Choose the right algorithm based on your needs:

| Problem Size | Time Constraint | Recommended Algorithm |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| < 100 sequences | No constraint | Exact (Branch & Bound) |
| 100-1000 sequences | Minutes | Greedy + Local Search |
| > 1000 sequences | Seconds | Fast Greedy |
| Any size | Best quality | Hybrid Multi-stage |

### Memory Usage

- **Sparse Graphs**: Use sparse matrix representations for large libraries
- **Streaming**: Process very large libraries in chunks
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple cores for speedup
